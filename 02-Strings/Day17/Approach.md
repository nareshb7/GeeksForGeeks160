# Notes for Day 17: Non Repeating Character (String's)

## Approach

- Take a Freq obj, store the count of each character;
- Iterate over the string again and check freq count of that variable, if its 1 return `charcter`;
- Otherwise return `$`

## Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(k) // k is the no.of character
