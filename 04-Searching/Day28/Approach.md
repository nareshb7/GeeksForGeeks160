# Notes for Day 28: Number of occurrence (Searching)

## Approach

- take a `cnt` variable
- `traverse` the array to calculate the target count
- break the loop if `val` is `greterthan` `target` val because array is `sorted`
- return the `cnt`

## Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(1)
