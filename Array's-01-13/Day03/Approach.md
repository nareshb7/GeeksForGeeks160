# Notes for Day 03: Reverse an Array (Array's)

## Approach

- We use `two pointers` to `left` and `right`;
- Use the while loop to traverse the array until left is less than right;
- In While loop just swap the left index value with right index value
- for every iteration decrease the right value and increase  the right value;

## Complexity

- Time complexity: O(log n)
- Space complexity: O(1)
