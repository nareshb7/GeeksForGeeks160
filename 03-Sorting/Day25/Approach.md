# Notes for Day 25: Insert Interval (Sorting)

## Approach

- Traverse the intervals to identify where the new interval fits.
- Merge overlapping intervals by adjusting the start and end times.
- Add all non-overlapping intervals to the result list.

## Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(n)
