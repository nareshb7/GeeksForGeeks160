# Notes for Day 20: Strings Rotations of Each Other (String's)

## Approach

- We need to check s1 is rotated string or not.
- So for that we just concat the string and check the indexOf s2 
- If s2 is rotated part then it will give us the index otherwise it will return -1;

## Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(n)
