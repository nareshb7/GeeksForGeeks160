# Notes for Day 05: Next Permutation (Array's)

## Approach

- first find the first decreasing element idnex
- then find the second largest element index to the first decreasing element index
- Swap the first element with second element
- Now reverse the part of the array after the first decresing element index

## Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(1)
