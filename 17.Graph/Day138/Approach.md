# Notes for Day 138: DFS of Graph

## Approach:

- Use a visited array to track visited nodes.
- Use recursion to traverse the graph in depth-first order.
- Follow the adjacency list order as given.

## Complexity

- Time Complexity: O(V+E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
- Space Complexity: O(V) for the visited array and recursion stack.
