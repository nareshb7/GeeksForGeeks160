// Find H-Index

// Given an integer array citations[], where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for the ith paper. The task is to find the H-index.

// H-Index is the largest value such that the researcher has at least H papers that have been cited at least H times.

// Examples:

// Input: citations[] = [3, 0, 5, 3, 0]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: There are at least 3 papers (3, 5, 3) with at least 3 citations.
