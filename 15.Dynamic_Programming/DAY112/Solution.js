// Longest Common Subsequence

// Given two strings s1 and s2, return the length of their longest common subsequence (LCS). If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

// A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given string by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, "ABE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE".

// Examples:

// Input: s1 = "ABCDGH", s2 = "AEDFHR"
// Output: 3
// Explanation: The longest common subsequence of "ABCDGH" and "AEDFHR" is "ADH", which has a length of 3.
