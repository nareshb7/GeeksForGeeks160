# Notes for Day 39: Search in a row-wise sorted matrix (Matrix)

## Approach:

- Iterate through the each and every value in the array by using nested loop;
- If the current value matches target return true
- Otherwise return false

## Complexity

- Time Complexity: O(n + m), where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns
- Space Complexity: O(1) (no extra space used).
