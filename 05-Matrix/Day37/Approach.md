# Notes for Day 37: Rotate by 90 degree (Matrix)

## Approach:

- Transpose the Matrix: Convert rows into columns.
- Reverse the Rows: Reverse the order of rows to achieve the counterclockwise rotation.

## Complexity

- Time Complexity: O(n^2)
- Space Complexity: O(1) â€” No additional space other than the result array.
